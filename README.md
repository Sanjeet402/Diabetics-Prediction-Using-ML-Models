# Diabetics-Prediction-Using-ML-Models


Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that, if left untreated and undiagnosed, can lead to severe complications. The diagnostic process for diabetes can be time-consuming, often involving patient referrals to diagnostic centers and consultations with healthcare professionals. Predictive analytics in healthcare presents a valuable opportunity to streamline this process by leveraging data to assist physicians in making timely and accurate decisions about patient health. Machine learning techniques offer a promising solution to this challenge.
This project aims to develop a predictive model for accurately identifying diabetes in patients. The dataset is divided into three subsets: the training dataset, used to train the model; the validation dataset, employed for hyperparameter tuning and assessing model performance; and the testing dataset, used to evaluate the model's predictive power. Various machine learning classification algorithms are applied to the Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD), provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This dataset contains diagnostic measures used to diagnose diabetes in patients. Performance metrics such as precision, accuracy, specificity, and recall are calculated using confusion matrices to evaluate the algorithms' effectiveness.
By comparing and analyzing the accuracy of different machine learning techniques, this study aims to determine which algorithm is best suited for predicting diabetes. Ultimately, the goal is to leverage machine learning methods to support healthcare professionals in the early detection of diabetes
